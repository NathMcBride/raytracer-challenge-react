This project currently makes use of webworkers via a react hook which wraps the web worker.
The webworker is generated by calling the to string method of the passed in function. 
On inspecting said function it can be noted that calls to imported functions are made via a reference generated in this case by Webpack.


the imports are numbered incorrectly between the injected functions and the functions from the stringified function


for example an 

```
(self.___WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__||(self.___WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__={})).point=(self[468599103]=(x, y, z) => ({
x,
y,
z,
w: 1.0
}));
```


call in stringified funtion body

```
const ray_origin = (0,___WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.point)(0, 0, -5);
```

to enable sharedArray buffers for development
setupProxy.js mention package too
